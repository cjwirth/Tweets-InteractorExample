An example to show how I use Interactors in my apps to keep my View Controllers reusable, testable, and dynamic.

Basically, I just use the [Strategy Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) to encapsulate the user interactions in an object.

I got the idea from the [VIPER architecture](http://mutualmobile.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/viper-introduction/), but couldn't take the time to refactor my entire app to use it -- so I combined some things together and ended up with these new kinds of "Interactors."
